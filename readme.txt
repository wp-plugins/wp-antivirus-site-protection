Plugin prevents access to admin area without appropriate access key and adds a higher level of security to your website.

== Description ==

Everybody knows that it's easy to access administrators  area of WordPress website using standard 
login page. That makes hacker's life much easier and your website security weaker. Anyone who 
has got a brutforce software can easily access the administrators login page and run the bruteforce 
software. If your login and password are not secure enough your website might be accessed by the 
thief. When we were working on our plugin we tried to make attacks on your website impossible.

WP Admin Protection prevents access to administration area without appropriate access key. This 
plugin adds a higher level of security to your WordPress website. Even with the correct login 
and password the hacker will not get access to administrator area without special secret key.
